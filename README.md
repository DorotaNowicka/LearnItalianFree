# LearnItalianFree
*Creating app in progress...*

This is an open-source app to help memorize vocabulary and  verbs conjugation from your language classes. Unlike other applications, it does not contain ready-made study kits.
However, unlike others, it is free - because easy learning should not be reserved for the wealthy.

I am creating this app basing on "The Ultimate React Native Series" by  Mosh Hamedani.

I am currently working on this app.
